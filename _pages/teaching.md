# COMP4423 Computer Vision
COMP4423 Computer Vision for Beginners at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

<br>

<!-- (Introduction here) -->

## 1. What we learn?

> "Learning CV by playing it"

We mainly focus on the following topics:
- Image Processing
- Feature Extraction
- Image Retrieval Fundamentals
- Image Classification Fundamentals
- Traditional Machine Learning to Deep Learning
- Deep Image Retrieval
- CAM, Attentions and Transformers
- Detection & Segmentation
- Learning Paradigms
- Large Models
- And more...

You can find learning details, slides, videos and other resources [here](https://github.com/lookwei/COMP4423)

## 2. What we have done?

### 2.1 Sign Language Recognition

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.liquid path="assets/video/SLR_Demo.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/sign_language.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/A1_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>

## 3. What is next?

In this course, we not only learn the basic knowledge of computer vision, but also apply and transform the knowledge into practical projects as well as further research topics.

Rubing Chen, Wengyu Zhang, Yiyang Jiang, as year 2 undergraduate students, took the course in 2023, and Tianyi Zhang, as a year 3 undergraduate student, took the course in 2024. They were further joined the PolySmart Group as student assistants for research and development projects.

You could find more information about the students' development and achievements [here](https://polysmartgroup.github.io/gain/).
