# COMP4423 Computer Vision
Computer Vision (CV) for beginners at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

<br>

<!-- (Introduction here) -->

## 1. What do we learn?

> "Learning CV by playing it."

We mainly focus on the following topics:
- Image Processing
- Feature Extraction
- Image Retrieval Fundamentals
- Image Classification Fundamentals
- Traditional Machine Learning to Deep Learning
- Deep Image Retrieval
- CAM, Attentions and Transformers
- Detection & Segmentation
- Learning Paradigms
- Large Models
- and more...

**You can find more information, such as the pre-requisite, in the official Subject Description Form [here](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/docdrive/ug/subject/COMP4423.pdf)**.

**You can find learning details, slides, videos, codes and other resources [here](https://github.com/lookwei/COMP4423)**.

## 2. What have we done?

## 3. What is next?

In this course, we not only learn the basic knowledge of computer vision but also apply and transform the knowledge into practical projects as well as further research topics.

Rubing Chen, Wengyu Zhang, and Yiyang Jiang, as year 2 undergraduate students, took the course in 2023, and Tianyi Zhang, as a year 3 undergraduate student, took the course in 2024. They have further joined the [PolySmart Group](https://polysmartgroup.github.io/) as student assistants for research and engineering projects.

You can find more information about the student's development and achievements [here](https://polysmartgroup.github.io/gain/).
