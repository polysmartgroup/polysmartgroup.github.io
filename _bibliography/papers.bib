  abstract={Inversion methods, such as Textual Inversion, generate personalized images by incorporating concepts of interest provided by user images. However, existing methods often suffer from overfitting issues, where the dominant presence of inverted concepts leads to the absence of other desired concepts. It stems from the fact that during inversion, the irrelevant semantics in the user images are also encoded, forcing the inverted concepts to occupy locations far from the core distribution in the embedding space. To address this issue, we propose a method that guides the inversion process towards the core distribution for compositional embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a spatial regularization approach to balance the attention on the concepts being composed. Our method is designed as a post-training approach and can be seamlessly integrated with other inversion methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in mitigating the overfitting problem and generating more diverse and balanced compositions of concepts in the synthesized images.

    title={Generative Active Learning for Image Synthesis Personalization},
    author={Xulu Zhang and Wengyu Zhang and Xiaoyong Wei and Jinlin Wu and Zhaoxiang Zhang and Zhen Lei and Qing Li},
    abstract={This paper presents a pilot study that explores the application of active learning, traditionally studied in the context of discriminative models, to generative models. We specifically focus on image synthesis personalization tasks. The primary challenge in conducting active learning on generative models lies in the open-ended nature of querying, which differs from the closed form of querying in discriminative models that typically target a single concept. We introduce the concept of anchor directions to transform the querying process into a semi-open problem. We propose a direction-based uncertainty sampling strategy to enable generative active learning and tackle the exploitation-exploration dilemma. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that an open-source model can achieve superior performance compared to closed-source models developed by large companies, such as Google's StyleDrop.

    title={Prior Knowledge Integration via LLM Encoding and Pseudo Event Regulation for Video Moment Retrieval},
    author={Yiyang Jiang and Wengyu Zhang and Xulu Zhang and Xiaoyong Wei and Chang Wen Chen and Qing Li},
    abstract={In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for integrating general knowledge and incorporating pseudo-events as priors for temporal content distribution in video moment retrieval (VMR) models. The motivation behind this study arises from the limitations of using LLMs as decoders for generating discrete textual descriptions, which hinders their direct application to continuous outputs like salience scores and inter-frame embeddings that capture inter-frame relations. To overcome these limitations, we propose utilizing LLM encoders instead of decoders. Through a feasibility study, we demonstrate that LLM encoders effectively refine inter-concept relations in multimodal embeddings, even without being trained on textual embeddings. We also show that the refinement capability of LLM encoders can be transferred to other embeddings, such as BLIP and T5, as long as these embeddings exhibit similar inter-concept similarity patterns to CLIP embeddings. We present a general framework for integrating LLM encoders into existing VMR architectures, specifically within the fusion module. The LLM encoder's ability to refine concept relation can help the model to achieve a balanced understanding of the foreground concepts (e.g., persons, faces) and background concepts (e.g., street, mountains) rather focusing only on the visually dominant foreground concepts. Additionally, we introduce the concept of pseudo-events, obtained through event detection techniques, to guide the prediction of moments within event boundaries instead of crossing them, which can effectively avoid the distractions from adjacent moments. The integration of semantic refinement using LLM encoders and pseudo-event regulation is designed as plug-in components that can be incorporated into existing VMR methods within the general framework. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods by achieving state-of-the-art performance in VMR.},

    title={A Picture Is Worth a Graph: A Blueprint Debate Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning},
    author={Changmeng Zheng and DaYong Liang and Wengyu Zhang and Xiaoyong Wei and Tat-Seng Chua and Qing Li},
    abstract={This paper presents a pilot study aimed at introducing multi-agent debate into multimodal reasoning. The study addresses two key challenges: the trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts. Extensive experiments validate BDoG, achieving state-of-the-art results in Science QA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods.},
